# SQL Data Analysis
The provided SQL query is designed to transform and aggregate data from a table named cht.budget_production. 

The objective is to pivot the data based on different columns representing months and then unpivot it to provide a normalized view. Subsequently, the query creates several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to handle different aspects of the data, such as quantities (Q_propre), values (V_propre), sales tax (ST), quantities for services (Q_Preste), and values for services (V_Preste).

The final result is a unified view of these metrics for each combination of Pole, CODE_NT, act, and month-year.

 #  Summary:

    Pivoting and Unpivoting: The query begins by applying the UNPIVOT operation on the original data, where quantities and values for each month are transformed from columns to rows. This dynamic reshaping of the data allows for easier analysis and aggregation.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

Quantities (cte): The first CTE (cte) focuses on quantities (Q_propre). It aggregates the monthly quantities for each combination of Pole, Code_NT, act, ANNEE, and CLE_PR. The result includes a new column MonthYear, formed by concatenating ANNEE and MONT.
Values (cte1), Sales Tax (cte2), Quantities for Services (cte3), Values for Services (cte4): Similar to cte, these CTEs handle values (V_propre), sales tax (ST), quantities for services (Q_Preste), and values for services (V_Preste). Each CTE follows the same pattern of aggregating and creating the MonthYear column.

Detailed Description:
Pivoting and Unpivoting:

The innermost subqueries utilize the SUM function to aggregate quantities and values for each combination of Pole, Code_NT, act, ANNEE, and CLE_PR.
The UNPIVOT operation transforms the columns representing individual months ([01] to [12]) into rows, resulting in a more streamlined and analytically friendly structure.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

Quantities (cte):

Aggregates monthly quantities for each combination of Pole, Code_NT, act, ANNEE, and CLE_PR.
Creates a new column MonthYear by concatenating ANNEE and MONT.
Values (cte1), Sales Tax (cte2), Quantities for Services (cte3), Values for Services (cte4):

These CTEs follow the same structure as cte, each handling a specific metric.
They aggregate monthly values, sales tax, quantities for services, and values for services, respectively.
Each CTE introduces the MonthYear column for uniformity across the data.
CTE cte handles quantities (Q_propre) and creates a column MonthYear by concatenating ANNEE and MONT.
CTE cte1 handles values (V_propre) with a similar structure to cte.
CTE cte2 handles sales tax (ST) in the same way.
CTE cte3 handles quantities for services (Q_Preste).
CTE cte4 handles values for services (V_Preste).

Final Result:

The final SELECT statement utilizes the CROSS APPLY clause to join the CTEs for each metric (cte, cte1, cte2, cte3, cte4) based on common attributes (Pole, CODE_NT, act, and MonthYear).
The result set includes columns for Pole, CODE_NT, act, MonthYear, and the metrics (Q_propre, V_propre, ST, Q_Preste, V_Preste).
The ordering of the result by Pole, act, and MonthYear provides a structured and intuitive presentation of the data.

In summary, this SQL query transforms and aggregates data from a source table, creating a normalized view of quantities, values, sales tax, quantities for services, and values for services for each combination of Pole, CODE_NT, act, and month-year. The use of CTEs and the CROSS APPLY clause facilitates the organization and combination of the data, and the final result is a powerful analytical dataset suitable for further business intelligence and reporting.
